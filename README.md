# NEXTStep
Originally i was going to build a React+Express+MongoDB app called NEXTStep, but I decided to switch to upSTEP (though i might keep the old name, it looks better)
# upSTEP
A light React+Vite app with just Python and SQLAlchemy on my backend.
I'm able to write python code into HTML files using the {%%} syntax, which has been a lot of fun and a nice break from all of the "reacting" that's been going on everywhere. Though in the end I'm still using Bootstrap.
